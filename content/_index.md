## Hi there! 👋

Hey, I'm François Petitit - a human being who lives in France, has been working in software development for a long time, and has many passions ;)

Currently, I work as a co-founder CTO of an innovative property management company : [Owwner](https://www.owwner.com). 

Before that, I spent several years as a senior Web developer at [La Ruche qui dit Oui!](https://www.laruchequiditoui.fr) a great ethical and fair trade e-commerce platform.

And even before that, I started my career at [OCTO Technology](https://www.octo.com), an extraordinary IT consultancy, as a consultant and leader of the front-end web tribe.

My main interests are web development and product design.

I hope you find something of interest by reading my articles.
Don't hesitate to leave me a message to start the conversation !
