## Hi there! 👋

Hey, I'm François Petitit - a French resident with extensive experience in software development and a wide range of passions (•‿•)

Currently, I work as a senior consultant at [OCTO Technology](https://www.octo.com), an extraordinary IT consultancy company, in Paris, France.

Previously, I worked as a co-founder CTO of an innovative property management company : [Owwner](https://www.owwner.com). 

Before that, I spent several years as a senior Web developer at [La Ruche qui dit Oui!](https://www.laruchequiditoui.fr) a great ethical and fair trade e-commerce platform.

And even before that, I started my career at [OCTO Technology](https://www.octo.com), as a consultant and leader of the front-end Web architecture tribe.

My main interests are web development and product design.

I hope you find something of interest by reading my articles.
