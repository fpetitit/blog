As you can see from this post, I've just launched a new blog.

It already includes a few old articles published elsewhere, here and there, and I'll try to publish new ones regularly.

But let's get technical !

This blog has been developed using the following tools:
- Hugo as the blog engine: https://gohugo.io/
- Github to store the code, compile the production version and deploy on Github Pages . You can take a look at the source code here : https://github.com/fpetitit/blog
- [OVH Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/) to manage the domain name

## Why did I choose Hugo?

There are a huge number of blog generation tools available. For example, I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a long time for similar purposes.
I'm also inevitably thinking of Wordpress, which is heavy and complex but still a potential alternative, and which still adds a lot of possibilities.

Finally, I chose Hugo mainly because a web design site that I've been following closely for years recently made this choice.
It's Smashing Magazine, and they detail their migration in an article : https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/switch-wordpress-hugo/.

Well, OK, since then they've switched to TinyCMS. But TinyCMS was far too heavy for my little blog ;)
